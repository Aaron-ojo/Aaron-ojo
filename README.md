ABOUT ME
I'm a passionately curious frontend developer who loves digging into the "why" behind every interaction and animation. My drive comes from constantly asking "How can this be better?" and "What makes this experience truly delightful?"

Currently, I'm expanding my skills by diving into backend development, working towards becoming a full-stack developer who can bring complete digital products to life.

My expertise lies in crafting modern, responsive interfaces with React and Tailwind CSS, where I enjoy turning complex design challenges into elegant, user-friendly solutions.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in competitive gaming sessions or enjoying a game of football ‚Äì both teaching me valuable lessons about strategy, teamwork, and quick thinking that I bring back to my development work.
