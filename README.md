## üëã About Me

I'm a **passionately curious frontend developer** who obsesses over the *"why"* behind every interaction and animation.  
My mantra: **‚ÄúHow can this be better?‚Äù** ‚Üí I turn complex designs into **delightful, responsive experiences**.

**Currently leveling up** to **full-stack** by diving into **Node.js + APIs** ‚Äî ready to ship end-to-end products.  
**Core strength:** Modern UIs with **React + Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî elegant, fast, pixel-perfect.

**Outside code:** Competitive gaming & football ‚Äî teaching me **strategy, teamwork, and split-second decisions** I apply to dev sprints.
